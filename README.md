# fb-network-analysis
To visualize where my facebook friends are located to facilitate meetups when travelling.

# some ideas for initial exploration 
1. Search for fb friends location 
2. Search for fb friends whom I haven't had contact for specific time periods 
3. Visualize location change over time & provide summary 


Update: API settings updated need to find another way to extract info ugh
